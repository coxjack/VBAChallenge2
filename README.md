Challenge 2 for Butler Data Science

## 1. Overview of project
### 
* Our goal in this project was to gather and analyze stock data from 2017 & 2018 and help our subject 
decide which Green Energy stocks should be invested in. We had data for 12 different stocks. The data included for these stocks was the ticker name, the date of market activity for each stock, opening price, closing price, the daily high, the daily low, adjusted closing price, and the daily volume. In the second part of this project our goal was to streamline our code to become more efficient.

## 2. Results
###
* On the whole the stocks performed better in 2017 than in 2018. Only tickers "RUN" and "TERP" performed better in 2018.
